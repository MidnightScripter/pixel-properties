# (Not Complete)Pixel Properties Real Estate

Pixel Properties Real Estate demo site.

## Summary

This was a technical submission for an interview that I did however all original company references, names, icons, and other image assets were swapped out. Originally, this was a simple HTML submission for CSS proficiency and proper semantic structure demonstration, but it's been updated and expanded to be a full mini React/Typescript based site.

## Special Notes

Please note that this is a Demo/Portfolio Site, not a real company and these properties and any site content or information is _NOT REAL_. The data is all made up and inspired by an RPG from the 90s.

Note that due to browser restrictions on navigator.geolocation, Search Near Me sometimes does not properly return your location when running locally. Firefox (not in-private) tabs seem to be the most reliable for testing this feature while running locally.
