# (Not Complete)Pixel Properties Real Estate

Pixel Properties Real Estate quick page.

## Summary

This was originally a technical submission for an interview that I did, though all original company references, names, and pictures were swapped out to serve as a practical demo. Originally, this was a simple HTML submission for CSS structure demonstration, but it's been updated to be a full mini React/Typescript based site.
