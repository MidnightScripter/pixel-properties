# (Not Complete)Pixel Properties Real Estate

Pixel Properties Real Estate quick page.

## Summary

This was a technical submission for an interview that I did however all original company references, names, icons, and other image assets were swapped out. Originally, this was a simple HTML submission for CSS proficiency and proper semantic structure demonstration, but it's been updated and expanded to be a full mini React/Typescript based site.
